FimExplorer
=========

Tool for executing XPath queries against FIM without going though it's horrible web portal.

What it can do:

* run any xpath query against FIM (you can choose what attributes will be fetched; all are fetched by default)
* find objects by ID
* display results in grid
* display single object information in a dialog (double-click the grid row)
* navigate through references (click on the ID link)
* export displayed results to XML (this one produces the same results as FIM migration cmdlets: Export-FIMConfig / ConvertTo-FIMResource / ConvertFrom-FIMResource, read MSDN for more info)
* import objects from XML (generated by FimExplorer or FIM cmdlets) and show them in grid; this can be useful for "offline" analysis
* it is not required to run on a machine with FIM installed

**Important**

It uses [Predica.FimCommunication library](https://github.com/Predica/FimClient) library under the hood. It is referenced as a Git submodule. So after you clone the FimExplorer repository make sure to also run "**git submodule init**" and "**git submodule update**" commands to download it!
